# Assignment2
sum of number from 1 to 50 and check the the number is even or odd

This repository contains two Python programs:

## 1. `task1.py`: Odd or Even Checker
This script takes an integer input from the user and tells whether the number is odd or even.

**Usage:**
```bash
python task1.py
```

**Example:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```
```
Enter a number: 12
12 is an even number.
```

**How it Works:**
- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2.
- If divisible, it prints "{number} is an even number."; otherwise, it prints "{number} is an odd number."

## 2. `task2.py`: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50 (Using a For Loop)
This script calculates and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

**Usage:**
```bash
python task2.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

**How it Works:**
- The program initializes a variable to hold the sum.
- It iterates through numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop, adding each number to the sum.
- It displays the result.
